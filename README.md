# Alexa-Clone-in-python-using-voice-command
A simple implementation of an Alexa-like voice assistant using the speech_recognition, pyttsx3, pywhatkit, wikipedia, and pyjokes libraries. The script listens for voice commands using the speech_recognition library and then processes the command to perform an action, such as playing a song or telling a joke. The pyttsx3 library is used to provide text-to-speech capabilities, allowing the assistant to speak back to the user. The pywhatkit library is used to play songs on YouTube, the wikipedia library is used to provide information about a given topic, and the pyjokes library is used to provide jokes. The script is set up to run continuously, allowing the user to issue multiple commands without having to restart the script.
